# Project Memory Recall

## Scope

Project memory keeps `MEMORY.md` as the always-loaded index. During code-mode
context assembly, the runtime may additionally recall indexed memory files when
their frontmatter `name` or `description` overlaps the current user prompt.

The recall path is intentionally conservative:

- Only Markdown files linked from `MEMORY.md` are eligible.
- Frontmatter is previewed for at most 12 lines and 25 KiB before scoring,
  stopping at its closing delimiter. Top-level `name` and `description` use
  the existing YAML parser (including folded/quoted scalars); nested fields
  cannot replace them and malformed YAML is not recalled.
- At most 4 files are recalled.
- Files outside the memory directory, including symlink targets, are rejected.
- Index, preview and body reads share an opened `os.Root`. Final reads remain
  rooted even if a symlink changes after preview. Absolute symlinks resolving
  inside the root remain supported via a rooted relative-path open.
- Each index/body read is bounded before allocation, then limited to 25 KiB /
  200 lines with UTF-8-safe truncation.
- Empty prompts and explicit ignore-memory requests recall no files.
- Existing `MEMORY.md` loading and the model's manual `Read` path remain intact.

## Cost And Safety

Recalled files use the existing memory document byte budgets. Recall adds file
reads and prompt bytes only for matching entries; it does not add model turns
or tool calls. A false match is possible because the matcher is deliberately
keyword-based, so the system prompt still requires current-state verification
before relying on a memory claim.

This is a `B2_MODE` prompt change for code mode. Chat mode and explicit bare
runtime context discovery do not use this path. The existing `MEMORY.md`
index remains loaded even on an ignore-memory request: the deterministic
disable boundary applies only to additional recalled documents. Manual tool
reads retain their existing permission boundaries.

`os.Root` is a path-traversal boundary, not a complete filesystem sandbox:
hard links, mounted filesystems and special files are not excluded by it.
Recall is keyword-based, not semantic retrieval; the native project slug
encoding also is not a collision-free multi-tenant isolation mechanism.
No new shared prompt, gate, tool permission or persistence format is introduced.
Rollback is limited to the memory fix commit and does not remove saved memories.

## Verification

Unit tests cover:

- matching an indexed memory by native `metadata.type` frontmatter;
- ignoring explicit memory-disable requests;
- rejecting `..` traversal;
- rejecting symlinks that resolve outside the memory directory;
- preserving the existing index-only behavior for empty prompts.
- YAML folded/quoted values, nested fields and malformed input;
- in-root relative/absolute links, replaced links and opened-root directory rename;
- oversized bodies, UTF-8, candidate caps, duplicate/missing/unindexed files
  and distinct workspace directories.

`scripts/memory-release-acceptance.py` adds isolated real-provider checks:
actual indexed writes, separate-process cold recall without tools, code/chat/bare
scope, readonly hashes, ignore/missing/unindexed negative paths and byte budgets.
Evidence uses the runtime's logical pre-provider request dump plus the actual
model response, not a claimed HTTP wire capture. See
[the dated acceptance report](../deployment/2026-09-10-dependencies-memory-acceptance.md).
