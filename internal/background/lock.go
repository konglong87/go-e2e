// that matters: the registry lives under ~/.golang-cc and is shared by every

// order goroutines within this process, since flock attaches to the open file
// description and two OpenFile calls therefore contend. The mutex is kept
// because on !unix there is no file lock at all (see lock_other.go), and there
// it is the only thing standing between two goroutines and a lost update.
