// The same sub-agent result reaches the parent through two different drivers —
// internal/goal drives it through goalCapabilityFollowUpLine, internal/query
// through capabilityloop.FollowUpLine — and both render a follow-up gate line
// from it. Before the fix the two disagreed about exactly one string: goal's
// private placeholder set omitted the machine-injected "completed" default, so
// goal published it as must_handle_next_action while query suppressed it. The
// parent was then told to discharge an obligation that does not exist, but only
// when it happened to be running under the goal driver.

// the defect is the *disagreement*, so the assertion has to compare the two
